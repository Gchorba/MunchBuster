##Imagine it's 12 AM, and you're up working, and hungry. But you gotta keep working, so you can't just get up and leave - and your stomache isn't getting any fuller. 

### *Enter: MunchBusters.*

MunchBusters is a food delivery service where people who want food from any, or a particular, location (Munchers) can interact with other people who can deliver (Busters) to arrange a food delivery. Prices for the actual service are negotiable among the two parties.
